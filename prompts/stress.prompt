IMPORTANT: Generate a BRUTE-FORCE solution for stress testing purposes. This code will be used to validate other solutions, so correctness is more important than efficiency.

Requirements:
1. Use the simplest, most straightforward brute-force algorithm
2. Prioritize correctness over optimization
3. The code MUST execute test cases IN PARALLEL using threading for faster stress testing
4. Use threading.Thread or concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor in the main function
5. Read all test inputs at once and process them concurrently
6. Output results in the same order as inputs

Structure your solution as follows:
- Define a solve() function that processes a single test case
- In main(), read all inputs and use threading to process them in parallel
- Collect and output results in order

Generate only the complete Python code without any explanation or markdown formatting.
